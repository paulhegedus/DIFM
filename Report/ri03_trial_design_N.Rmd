Figure \@ref(fig:tgtn-yield-ap) displays the trial design and the resultant as-applied map.  Casual observation shows that <!--NEED to determine and assign:  "trial implementation was basically accurate", or "the accuracy of trial implementation was limited by" (add text by hand) -->.  

The field's status quo planting plan (that is, the one that would have been used had there been no field trial conducted) was to _grower-plan-here_.  

Plots were all `r plot_width` feet wide.  Plot were all between <!--shortest_plot_length_hereK--> and <!--longest_plot_length_hereK-->feet long. A rate of <!--buffer_zone_rate_hereK--> per acre was assigned to a buffer zone around the perimeter of the trial, but observations from the buffer zone were not included as part of the trial in later analysis. Figure \@ref(fig:tgtn-yield-ap) pairs the trial's design, as-applied, and yield maps.
